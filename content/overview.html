<h3>Appomattox River Trail</h3>
<p>The Appomattox River Trail is a 25 mile long trail along the lower Appomattox River with access points connecting to boat access, parks, and other riverside trails. It encompasses the counties of Chesterfield, Dinwiddie and Prince George, and the cities of Colonial Heights, Hopewell and Petersburg.</p>

<div id="questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>What will be the measurable positive impacts of completing the Appomattox River Trail (Blueway and Greenway) for the Petersburg and surrounding region?</p>
<p>What policies and/or systems changes can help facilitate achieving and maintaining the beneficial impacts?</p>
</div>
<div id="goals" class="section level3">
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Being that Petersburg has had a trend of limited knowledge of trails and there exact  impacts that they can have. We decided to focus our approach into the following topics: Economics, Transportation, and Health Factors while also keeping policies in mind.</p>

<p>The Petersburg Active Transportation Chapter, alongside FOLAR,has been plotting a comprehensive plan for enhancing the accessibility of Petersburg for walking and biking. The expansion of the Appomattox trail has consequences that would improve connectivity within Petersburg and the adjacent counties.</p>

<p>If given the chance and the results come out positive, it would be motivation to go forward with these other plans that would increase connectivity throughout all of Petersburg and the surrounding areas with more trails and biking paths. And in doing so would enhance the ability for people to access everything Petersburg has to offer.</p>

<p>These local business, parks, and historic landmarks are only part of what I could accurately plot in the given time frame, but even with this tiny snapshot, increased connectivity means increased foot traffic through all these vital areas which would potentially improve the economy and and health of the people in Petersburg overall. Connectivity is what makes trails valuable because connectivity allows for the rest of the region to flourish.

<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Petersburg has measurable health and wealth disparities.Despite availability and desire, accessibility and perceived safety limit usage of local trails and parks.</p>
<p>Other means of transport exist but are not as accommodating for whole households.There is pre-existing evidence for the value trails brings to a locality. </p>

<p>The expansion and improvement of the Appomattox Trail has the potential for economic and health benefits. Proving the Appomattox Trail works can make the case for expanding and improving additional paths for pedestrians and bikers
