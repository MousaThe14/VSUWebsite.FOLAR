<h3>Conclusion and Policy Implications</h3>
<p>Keeping in mind that most of the city of petersburg lives below the poverty line we decided to take a look at the community options available. Most people preferred a car as there preferred means of transportation and in a household most owned at least one car. The average person in a household in the city is 2.34 and with that in mind we thought well if they donâ€™t have access to the family car how could they be able get to the trail. The graph on the right shows the comparison of the walking, biking and transit scores of Petersburg, Colonial Heights and the capital of virginia(Richmond,Va). This graph showed us that Petersburg should look into enhancing the current methods of transportation that the community has to rely on. The idea of adding the biking lanes to the trail is a great idea but maybe should be expanded to other areas of the community to help promote the idea of biking and what the benefits could be health wise. As well as adding sidewalks along the underdeveloped side of the trail to increase the chances of people from the local businesses wanting to take a stroll along the trail.</p>
