<h3>Economic Profile</h3>
<p>The current maps represent an overview of the city of Petersburg, VA and as you see they have large economic disparities. As I direct your attention closer to the map on the right you will see there is High Amounts of residents living below the poverty line and only one area that has houses only 10% below the poverty line.. This snapshot of Petersburg is relevant because one of the values of expanding and improving the trails is facilitating the economic development of Petersburg. </p>

<h3>Economic Impact</h3>
<p>To justify that trails have economic impact we decided to take a look at the Virginia Capital trail. This trail brought in 6.1 million in visitor spending along with 3.6 million in wages and salaries alone in 2019. With this information in mind we can see the potential financial improvement that this could have on the current community in Petersburg,VA. </p>
<p>Another study from Preservation Virginia in partnership with Virginia Commonwealth University found many major economics benefits to trails and national parks for Virginia overall as a state from visitations and tourism. Visitation brought in 3,598 jobs in virginia and a estimated 176 million spent. The current plans for Petersburg,VA is to expand the trail an approximate two miles across the river through Pocahontas island, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.With the extension and improvement of the trail we hope to see a rise in local business which in return will be more jobs for the local communit.</p>
