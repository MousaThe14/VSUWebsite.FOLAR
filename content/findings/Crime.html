<h3>Crime</h3>
<p>Keeping safety in mind we decided to take a look at the current state of the city’s crime. We found that the city of Petersburg,Va is currently ranked the most dangerous city in Virginia. The chart on the right hand side shows a breakdown of the type of crimes and their comparison to Virginia overall and the national stats. The map to the left shows the areas that have the most reported crimes. As you look you will see some of the areas are along the trail and could make some people not want to visit because of the fear of safety. </p>

<div id="Policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Policies</h3>
<p>With safety as one of the communities main concern we decided to look at a couple of policies to see how they can help implement some safety measures. One policy we found was the streetlight policy and this policy is for all the lighting in the city. This city policy states that the lights can be installed by the cities funding and monthly electric fees would be covered. If cities funding isn’t available then the applicant can pay for the installation themselves and the city will still cover the monthly electric charges.</p>
<p>Another policy we found was the closed circuit television policy. This policy was put in place by law enforcement for Petersburg national battlefield park. This is a policy that allows the use of camera monitoring for security purposes that will also keep first amendment safeguards in place. With this policy in place they are hoping to facilitate the detection, investigation and prevention of crime. Being that the trail would be considered a public area for the use of  multiple activities like most parks we are hoping that the trail could utilize or become a part of this current policy to help ensure the community that safety is a top priority, so that everyone can utilize the trail. </p>
