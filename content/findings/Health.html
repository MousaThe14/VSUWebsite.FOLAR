<h3>Health Outcomes</h3>
<p>The city of Petersburg is currently ranked last for health outcomes in the state of Virginia. Obesity is at a all time high with 40% and Diabetes is at a high of 14.6% which you see the graphs on the right show just how high they are in comparison to the entire state and national percentages. Because these number were so high we wanted to look at the communities involvement and access to exercise opportunities. The graph on the left shows the current access that the community has to exercise opportunities Vs the actual documented uses of physical activity. On paper there is plenty of access to exercise opportunities but there is a disconnect to people utilizing these opportunities. We hope with the completion of the trail that we can connect the community to utilize the trail and help increase the communities involvement in exercise to better health outcomes.</p>

<h3>Access to Parks</h3>
<p>Possible reasons for the health disparity despite the high park ranking is that one of the known factors for health is level of poverty. The access points exist alongside some of these low income areas but the trail that runs through is not a complete one at all. There are many reasons for this, such as safety and policies that will be covered later on, but also these park areas are wildly underdeveloped.</p>

<p>Despite the high park ranking, as you can see Petersburg has many parks in their low income areas but the same amount of relative health. If one were to examine the parks themselves theyâ€™ll see a lot of small and sometimes fields of grass with little interest with maybe a few playgrounds. However in southern Petersburg are the Lee Memorial Park, one of the largest parks in the area, and the Petersburg Sports Complex which is a high capacity facility with access to various exercise and sports equipment.
