<p>While this page is <em>optional</em>, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:</p>
<div id="variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>[Race]
[Age]
[Poverty]
[income]
[Education Levels]
[crime data]
[jobs/industries/economics]</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>[data discovery process]
[challenges with finding data]</p>
</div>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>[List your references here using APA format (or at least standardize all of the references using the same format).]</p>
<p>[description of relevance of data sources]</p>
</div>
