While this page is *optional*, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:

### Variables

[Race]
[Age]
[Poverty]
[income]
[Education Levels]
[crime data]
[jobs/industries/economics]

### Methods
[data discovery process]
[challenges with finding data]

### Data Sources

[List your references here using APA format (or at least standardize all of the references using the same format).]

[description of relevance of data sources]
