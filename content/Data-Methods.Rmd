While this page is *optional*, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:

### Variables

[Race]
[Age]
[Poverty]
[income]
[Education Levels]
[crime data]
[jobs/industries/economics]

### Methods
[challenges with finding data]
[Problem Identification ]

[Data Discovery/Data Ingestion]
[Filtering data sources and importing data into R server]
[Using ggplot defining multiple variables to compare]
[Aligning demographic and location data in QGIS]


### Data Sources
[American Community Survey 2018 5-Year Estimates]
[US Census Bureau Geographic Support System]
